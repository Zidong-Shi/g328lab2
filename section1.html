        Introduction: The Relationship Between Study Time and Academic Performance<br>
        <br>
        Education plays a crucial role in shaping students' futures, and one of the most debated factors influencing academic success is **study time**. Students, educators, 
        and researchers have long examined the relationship between the amount of time spent studying and the **grades** achieved. The common belief is that increased study 
        time leads to better academic performance, but the correlation is not always straightforward. Factors such as study techniques, concentration levels, and individual 
        learning styles all contribute to how effectively students absorb information.  
        Numerous studies have shown that **students who dedicate more time to studying** tend to achieve higher grades. Research papers and academic articles consistently 
        highlight a **positive correlation** between structured study habits and academic success. However, the effectiveness of study time also depends on **quality over 
        quantity**â€”simply spending long hours studying does not guarantee higher grades if the methods used are ineffective. Students who engage in **active learning techniques**, 
        such as summarization, practice testing, and spaced repetition, often see **better results** than those who rely solely on passive reading or last-minute cramming.  
        While study time is an important predictor of academic performance, other variables, such as **motivation, classroom engagement, socioeconomic background, and 
        personal discipline**, also influence grades. Additionally, the balance between study time and other activities, such as sleep and social interactions, plays a 
        critical role in overall student well-being and learning efficiency. This research aims to explore the relationship between **study time and academic performance**, 
        investigating how different study habits impact grades and whether an optimal amount of study time exists. By understanding this connection, students and educators 
        can develop better strategies for improving learning outcomes and academic success.
